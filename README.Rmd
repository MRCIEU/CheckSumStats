# mrQC

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

mrQC is an R package for checking the accuracy of meta- and summary-data for outcome traits prior to their use in two-sample Mendelian randomisation analyses. For example, the package provides tools for checking that the reported effect allele and effect allele frequency columns are correct. It also checks for possible errors in the summary data that might introduce bias into downstream Mendelian randomisation analyses.   

## Installation

To install the latest version of mrQC, perform as normal:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("MRCIEU/mrQC")

```
## General overview 

This package exploits three groups of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in order to identify potential errors or issues: 1) **A MAF 1KG reference set**. This is a set of 2297 SNPs that have the same minor allele across the 1000 genomes super populations and that have a minor allele frequency between 0.1 and 0.3; 2) **GWAS catalog top hits**. These are SNPs in the GWAS catalog that are strongly associated with the outcome trait of interest; and 3) the **exposure SNPs** or genetic instruments for the exposure of interest. 

The package performs 4 types of checks: 

1) confirm the identity of the effect allele frequency column. This step relies on comparison of the MAF reference set between the outcome study and 1000 genomes reference dataset.
2) confirm the identity of the effect allele column. This step relies on comparison of GWAS hits between the outcome study and the GWAS catalog.    
3) assess the ancestral origins of the study. This step relies on comparison of the MAF reference set between the outcome study and 1000 genomes reference dataset.  
4) for case-control studies, identify potential errors or issues in the effect sizes. This step can use any of the SNP sets. 

## Step 1. Extract and format the outcome summary data

The first step is to make a list of SNP rsids. Let's assume our outcome trait of interest is glioma. Let's identify the top GWAS hits for glioma in the GWAS catalog. We will search using both the reported trait name as well as the trait experimental factor ontology (EFO). It is advisable to search for both because not all studies in the GWAS catalog have up-to date EFO annotations. Searching for both therefore maximises the number of retrieved hits. 


```{r make_snplist1, eval = TRUE}
library(mrQC)
snplist<-make_snplist(efo="glioma",trait="glioma",ref1000G_superpops=FALSE)
head(snplist)
length(snplist)
```
We see that searching on the glioma EFO and glioma trait retrieves 54 unique SNP rsids. We could also have searched on the glioma efo_id (EFO_0005543), which would have retrieved the same SNPs as searching on the "glioma" efo.

```{r make_snplist2, eval = FALSE}
snplist<-make_snplist(efo_id="EFO_0005543",ref1000G_superpops=FALSE) 
```

In the above examples we set ref1000G_superpops to FALSE. We now set this to TRUE, which will result in a SNP list that includes the "MAF reference set". This is a set of 2297 SNPs that have the same minor allele across all 1000 genomes super populations and a minor allele frequency of 0.1-0.3.  


```{r make_snplist3, eval = TRUE}
snplist<-make_snplist(efo="glioma",trait="glioma",ref1000G_superpops=TRUE) 
head(snplist)
length(snplist)
```

We can also define a set of "exposure SNPs" and include this in the list of rsids. For example, let's assume we are conducting a Mendelian randomisation study to assess the effect of polyunsaturated fatty acid exposure on risk of glioma. Let's define the "exposure SNPs", or genetic instrument, as SNPs associated with polyunsaturated fatty acids with a P value <5e-8. Let's use the ieugwasr package to extract "exposure SNPs" for polyunsaturated fatty acids from the Open GWAS project and also add these to the SNP list. 

```{r make_snplist4, eval = TRUE}
instruments<-ieugwasr::tophits(id="met-d-PUFA",pval = 5e-08)
snplist<-make_snplist(efo = "glioma",trait="glioma",ref1000G_superpops=TRUE,snplist_user=instruments$rsid)
head(snplist)
length(snplist)
```

Our SNP list now contains the rsids for: 1) the GWAS catalog top hits, 2) the MAF reference set and 3) the "exposure SNPs". Next, we extract the summary associations statistics for these SNPs from the glioma outcome dataset. The example below has already been restricted to the three sets of SNPs to save space and time. Note: the extract_snps function only works on MAC or linux operating systems. 

```{r extract_snps1, eval = TRUE}
File<-system.file("extdata", "glioma_test_dat.txt", package = "mrQC")
gli<-extract_snps(snplist=snplist,path_to_target_file=File,path_to_target_file_sep="\t")
dim(gli)
head(gli)
```

In the above example, we extracted the summary data for the SNPs of interest from a tab separated text file that was stored on our local machine. In practice, this might correspond to a file of GWAS results obtained via correspondence with a GWAS consortium. Alternatively, we could have sourced the outcome summary data from the Open GWAS project (https://gwas.mrcieu.ac.uk/). For example, to extract summary data for thyroid cancer from Open GWAS we could run:

```{r extract_snps2,eval = TRUE}
snplist<-make_snplist(efo = "thyroid carcinoma",trait="thyroid carcinoma",ref1000G_superpops=TRUE,snplist_user=instruments$rsid)
head(snplist)
length(snplist)
thy <- ieugwasr::associations(id="ieu-a-1082", variants=snplist,proxies=0)  
dim(thy)
thy
```

The make_snplist() function returns a warning that no GWAS hits were found when searching for thyroid carcinoma in the GWAS catalog's "reported trait" field. The search was, however, able to identify hits when searching for "thyroid carcinoma" in the efo field.   

Returning to the glioma example, having extracted the summary data for the three sets of SNPs, we now need to format the summary data. This is to get the data into the expected format for the QC functions. 

```{r format_data1,eval = TRUE}
Dat<-format_data(dat=gli,outcome="Glioma",population="European",pmid=22886559,study="GliomaScan",ncase="cases",ncontrol="controls",UKbiobank=FALSE,rsid="Locus",effect_allele="Allele1",other_allele="Allele2",or="OR",lci="OR_95._CI_l",uci="OR_95._CI_u",eaf="eaf.controls",p="p",efo="glioma")
head(Dat)
```

In this example, the glioma results file contained columns for the odds ratio and 95% confidence intervals. In practice, the format of the effect size columns is highly variable across studies. For example, some studies may report the log odds ratio and its standard error or the odds ratio and P value without confidence intervals or a standard error. The format_data() function accepts these and other effect size reporting formats. See ?format_data() for more info.    

Now we are ready to perform some quality checks on the summary data

## Step 2. Check that the effect allele frequency column is correct

Next we create some plots to visualise potential problems with the effect allele frequency column. We do this by comparing allele frequency in the outcome glioma dataset to the 1000 genomes super populations. Let's restrict the comparison to the European super population, since we know that the glioma dataset was derived from a European ancestry population. 

```{r make_maf_plot1,eval = TRUE}
Plot1<-make_plot_maf(ref_1000G="EUR",target_dat=Dat)
Plot1
```

SNPs with a red colour are SNPs with incompatible minor allele frequencies, i.e. the allele frequencies are above 0.5 in the outcome dataset but less than 0.5 in the 1000 genomes dataset. In this example, all SNPs are flagged as problematic and there is a strong inverse correlation in minor allele frequency between the datasets. This indicates that the reported effect allele frequency column, in the outcome dataset, does not correspond to the reported effect allele. The strong inverse correlation implies that the effect allele column actually refers to the non-effect allele. 

Next we construct a similar plot but this time comparing allele frequency with all 1000 genomes super populations.

```{r make_maf_plot2,eval = TRUE}
Plot2<-make_plot_maf(ref_1000G=c("AFR","AMR","EAS","EUR","SAS","ALL"),target_dat=Dat)
Plot2
```


All SNPs across all super populations are flagged as problematic. This  illustrates that the function can identify problematic SNPs regardless of the ancestry of the outcome dataset. We also see a strong inverse correlation in the comparison with the European 1000 genomes super population. This is not surprising, since we know that the the glioma GWAS results were generated in a European ancestry population. This illustrates that the strength of the correlation in MAF between the datasets can also support inferences about the ancestral background of the outcome dataset, although the function was not designed with this objective in mind. A more efficient approach would be to select SNPs with a much wider range of variation in minor allele frequency that chosen here. 


## Step 3. Check that the effect allele column is correct

We next compare effect alleles between the glioma outcome dataset and the GWAS catalog, in order identify potential mis-specification of the effect allele column.   


```{r make_gwascatalog_plot1,eval = TRUE}
Plot3<-make_plot_gwas_catalog(dat=Dat,efo=unique(Dat$efo),trait="glioma")
Plot3
```

We see that there are three groups of SNPs: those flagged as showing no effect size conflict; those with moderate effect size conflict; and those with high effect size conflict. The distinction between moderate and high effect size conflict is arbitrary but is specified to make allowance for chance deviations between datasets. If the effect sizes are in opposite directions, the effect size conflict flag is set to moderate or high. If the two-sided P value in both datasets is ≤0.0001 then the flag is upgraded to high. In addition, if the summary association statistics in the outcome dataset and GWAS catalog are derived from the same publication, and effect sizes are in opposite directions, the conflict flag is set to high regardless of P value. 

Overall, the plot shows that the majority of SNPs show effect size conflicts. In other words, alleles associated with higher risk of glioma in the GWAS catalog tend to be associated with lower risk of glioma in the outcome dataset. This indicates that the reported effect allele column corresponds to the non-effect allele. Taken together with the previous allele frequency plots, showing an inverse correlation in MAF between the outcome dataset and 1000 genomes European superpopulation, this strongly indicates that the effect and non-effect allele columns have been incorrectly specified. The reported non-effect allele column is very likely the effect allele column.

We can also make a plot comparing effect allele frequency between the outcome dataset and the GWAS catalog, which we show in the next example.

```{r make_gwascatalog_plot2,eval = TRUE}
Plot4<-make_plot_gwas_catalog(dat=Dat,plot_type="plot_eaf",efo=unique(Dat$efo),trait=unique(Dat$outcome))
Plot4
```

We see an inverse correlation in effect allele frequency (EAF) between the outcome glioma dataset and the GWAS catalog in European ancestry studies. This is the expected pattern when the effect allele column has been incorrectly specified. In general, the EAF conflict flag is set to moderate or high if EAF is not consistent between the outcome dataset and the GWAS catalog (e.g. is <0.5 in the outcome dataset but is >0.5 in the GWAS catalog or vice versa). For conflicting SNPs, the flag is further upgraded to high if effect allele frequency is >0.6 or <0.4. This makes allowance for chance deviations in allele frequency for SNPs with minor allele frequency close to 0.5.   

## Step 4. Check whether the reported effect size corresponds to log odds ratios and has the expected distribution

We next compare the predicted log odds ratio to the reported effect size, in order to identify other potential errors or issues. This step is applicable to summary data that has been derived from a case-control genome-wide association study. 


```{r make_plot_predlnor1,eval = TRUE,results='hide'}
Pred<-predict_lnor_sh(dat=Dat)
Plot5<-make_plot_predlnor(dat=Pred)
Plot5
```
The plot shows a strong positive correlation between the predicted log odds ratios and the reported effect size, an intercept close to zero and a slope that is >0.8. When the predicted log odds ratios and reported effect sizes are identical, the intercept should be 0 and the slope should be 1.  

We can also plot the relative bias, i.e. the percentage deviation of the predicted log odds ratio from the reported effect size. 

```{r make_plot_predlnor3,eval = TRUE}
Plot6<-make_plot_predlnor(dat=Pred,bias=TRUE)
Plot6
```
Overall the relative bias seems small and mostly varies from -10.9% to -13.5%. Since genetic effect sizes tend to be small, a relative bias of 10% is very small in absolute terms.  

In the next example we show a dataset that returns a slope and intercept very different from expectation

```{r make_plot_predlnor2,eval = TRUE,results='hide'}
snplist<-make_snplist(efo = "kidney cancer",snplist_user=instruments$rsid)
ukb <- data.frame(ieugwasr::associations(id="ukb-b-1316", variants=snplist,proxies=0),stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
Ukb<-format_data(dat=ukb,outcome="Kidney cancer",population="European",pmid="ukb-b-1316",ncase=1114,ncontrol=461896,study="UKB",UKbiobank=TRUE,rsid="rsid",effect_allele="ea",other_allele="nea",lnor="beta",se="se",eaf="eaf",p="p",effect_allele_confirmed=TRUE,all_summary_stats=TRUE,ID=145,efo = "kidney cancer")
Pred<-predict_lnor_sh(dat=Ukb)
Plot5_2<-make_plot_predlnor(dat=Pred)
Plot5_2
```

Although there is a strong positive correlation, the slope is 400, when we expect a slope of 1. In fact, further investigation revealed that Open GWAS dataset ukb-b-1316 was generated using a linear model. In other words, the results were derived from a model where kidney cancer case-control status (controls coded 1 and cases coded 2) was regressed on SNP genotype (additively coded). The effect size from this model can be interpreted as the absolute risk of kidney cancer per copy of the  effect allele. We can transform this into a log odds ratio scale using the transform_betas() function.   

```{r make_plot_predlnor4,eval = TRUE,results='hide'}
Ukb2<-transform_betas(dat=Ukb,effect="lnor",effect.se="se")
Pred2<-predict_lnor_sh(dat=Ukb2)
Plot5_3<-make_plot_predlnor(dat=Pred2)
Plot5_3
```

After transforming the reported effect size to a log odds ratio scale, we now see a slope close to 1 for the relationship with the predicted log odds ratio. More generally, we suggest that any dataset with an unusual intercept or with a slope very different from 1 (e.g. <0.8 or >1.2) should be investigated by the user for potential problems. In the glioma example, the slope and intercept look reasonably close to what we'd expect. In the kidney cancer example, the slope was very different from 1 because the reported effect sizes had not been generated in a logistic regression model. Other factors that could cause the slope to differ from 1 include: 1) the impact of covariate adjustment in the original GWAS, 2) deviations from Hardy Weinberg equilibrium, 3) mismatches between reported and actual allele frequency for some or all SNPs or 4) mismatches between the reported and effective SNP-level sample sizes for some or all SNPs.    

## Step 5. Check whether the reported P values correspond to the reported effect sizes  

Let's now return back to the glioma dataset. Let's generate some ZZ plots, in order to flag SNPs with P values that don't coincide with their reported effect sizes. The zz_plot() function compares Zp scores (inferred from the reported P values) to Zb scores (inferred from the reported effect size and standard error).


```{r make_zz_plot1,eval = TRUE}
Plot7<-zz_plot(dat=Dat)
Plot7
```

The correlation between the Zp and Zb scores is 1, indicating very strong concordance between the reported P values and reported effect sizes in the glioma dataset for the selected SNPs. In the next example, we highlight a dataset where there is discordance between the reported P values and effect sizes. 

```{r make_zz_plot2,eval = TRUE}
instruments<-ieugwasr::tophits(id="met-d-PUFA")
snplist<-make_snplist(efo = "lung carcinoma",snplist_user=instruments$rsid)
luc <- ieugwasr::associations(id="ieu-a-966", variants=snplist,proxies=0)  
Dat<-format_data(dat=data.frame(luc,stringsAsFactors=F),outcome="Lung cancer",population="European",pmid=24880342,ncase=11348,ncontrol=15861,study="ILCCO",UKbiobank=FALSE,rsid="rsid",effect_allele="ea",other_allele="nea",lnor="beta",se="se",eaf="eaf",p="p",efo = "lung carcinoma")
Plot7_2<-zz_plot(dat=Dat)
Plot7_2
```

The correlation between the Zp and Zb scores is less than 1, suggesting discordance between the reported P values and reported effect sizes, which is also clear from visual inspection of the plot. For example, 1 SNP has a Z score close to 15 when estimated from the reported P value but a Z score close to 5 when estimated from the reported effect size and standard error. In this example, we have included three sets of SNPs (the GWAS catalog hits, the MAF reference set and the "exposure SNPs". Let's restrict the comparison to only the "exposure SNPs".


```{r make_zz_plot3,eval = TRUE}
luc <- ieugwasr::associations(id="ieu-a-966",variants=instruments$rsid,proxies=0)  
Dat<-format_data(dat=data.frame(luc,stringsAsFactors=F),outcome="Lung cancer",population="European",pmid=24880342,ncase=11348,ncontrol=15861,study="ILCCO",rsid="rsid",effect_allele="ea",other_allele="nea",lnor="beta",se="se",eaf="eaf",p="p",efo = "lung carcinoma")
Plot7_3<-zz_plot(dat=Dat)
Plot7_3
```

The correlation between the Zp and Zb scores is slightly less than 1, suggesting a small degree of discordance between the reported P values and reported effect sizes, which is also clear from visual inspection of the plot. For example one SNP has a Zp score >2 and Zb score <2. Some SNPs have P values a bit more extreme than you'd expect given the magnitude of the reported effect sizes and standard errors. 


## Step 6. Combine all plots into a single report 

Next we combine all the plots into a single report.

```{r combine_plots1,eval = TRUE}
Plot_list2<-ls()[grep("Plot[0-9]",ls())] 
Plot_list<-lapply(1:length(Plot_list2),FUN=function(x) eval(parse(text=Plot_list2[x])))
combine_plots(Plot_list=Plot_list,out_file="~/qc_report.png")
```

!["qc_report.png"](/man/figures/README-qc_report.png)

Overall, we can conclude that the reported effect allele column in the glioma summary dataset actually corresponds to the non-effect allele. Therefore, in order to avoid effect allele coding errors in downstream Mendelian randomisation analyses, we need to set the effect allele to the reported non-effect allele.
